## 📚 Project Context

> This project was created at **gibb** during the *Modul 320* course.  
>  
> It was built to apply and deepen my understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming** using Java.  
>  
> I developed different tank types with shared and unique properties, then brought it all together with a JavaFX UI based on the **MVC pattern**.  
>  
> The focus was on clean structure, solid logic, and good separation of concerns.
